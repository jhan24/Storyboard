# Storyboard

To help people on osu! make storyboard animations.
Written in java, so you can use knowledge of java
and java's inherent functions (such as loops, arrays)
to help you make storyboards.

Also contains various checking elements (including proportion,
duplicate events, overlapping events, etc.)

I'll add more about how to use this later.

GUI soon. And by soon I mean like within a decade.
