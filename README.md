# Storyboard

To help people on osu! make storyboard animations.
Written in java, so you can use knowledge of java
and java's inherent functions (such as loops, arrays)
to help you make storyboards.

The program can also retrieve previous values for you. 
For example, if you want to make a fade event and want
to have it reuse the last fade event's ending opacity,
the program can automatically find that ending opacity 
for you and set it as the new starting opacity.

But in order for this to work, your events must be
created and programmed in order of their starting time. 
You could also order by groups. (Ex: All fade events together and
ordered by starting time, then all move events together and
ordered by starting time, etc.)

Also contains various checking elements (including proportion,
duplicate events, overlapping events, etc.)

I'll add more about how to use this later.
It's really not user-friendly yet, but I'll do something about that. Soon.

GUI soon. And by soon I mean like within a decade.
